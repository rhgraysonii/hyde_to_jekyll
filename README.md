# HydeToJekyll
## Intention
A lot of people run a blog backed by a relational database.
Often, the rendered HTML of this code is easily accessible.
This is a gem that strives to take that, and with a single operatoin create a jekyll page, removing the need
for a database from your blog, and allowing you to adopt the wonderful way of life that is markdown and Vi
for all blogging desires.
